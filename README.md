The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On 15th april 1912, the widely considered “unsinkable” Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of passengers and crew members. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this Datasets, 
we will try to build a predictive model which help to understand and analysis of this Disaster.
